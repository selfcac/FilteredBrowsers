=========== Youtube NSFW ==============   
  
  if host contain: youtube.com
  
  <insert original (which was sent???)> --> Replace in request!

=========== REDDIT NSFW ============== 
    ==> check r/<somthingunsafe> if not relocated, NSFW allowed
    ==> block "reddit.com/over18"

https://old.reddit.com/r/NSFW
cookie: as SAME

302
location: https://old.reddit.com/over18?
=========== Google NSFW ==============   

also google search safe

=========== Where to put filters? ==============   

IResourceRequestHandler (AddSecretHandler):
    Like proxy, raw request (headers etc...) - Response unchanegabel!!
    
RequestHandler (WinFormsRequestHandler):
    OnBeforeBrowse : true\false - Block?
    
Look like not needing to change response on proxy level.
Just make some event to change HTML using js to block ... (On navigation \ With Timer ?)

=========== TODO-s ==============   
- Above filters (Safe search etc...)
    - reddit?
- propitery
- Block on adress change also

- Add command "Psexec - EXE - bypass pass"
    - choose hard password
